# Pico W Game Emulator  

## Introduction  

This project runs on [BitDogLab](https://github.com/BitDogLab/BitDogLab), an educational STEM device equipped with a Raspberry Pi Pico W and various peripherals. You can read more about the platform [here](https://www.fee.unicamp.br/bitdoglab-a-revolucao-no-ensino-de-eletronica-programacao-e-iot/). The goal is to play classic games like Snake, Pong, and Space Invaders in an embedded environment using MicroPython.  

### Hardware Components
- RP2040 microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico W)  
- SSD1306 OLED screen (128x64, I2C)  
- Analog joystick (X/Y axis for movement)  
- Buttons (for menu interaction)  
- Buzzer (for sound effects)

## Demonstration
<!-- Place images and videos -->

## How to Run the Project  
1. Flash MicroPython onto the Raspberry Pi Pico W  
2. Copy the `.py` files to the Pico W using Thonny IDE  
3. Run `main.py`
